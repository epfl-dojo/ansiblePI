## Usage

```

```

### Specifying a tag

```

### Both

ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.yml playbook.yml -l hostentry -t "test"
```

## Notes

### Failed to set permissions on the temporary files Ansible needs to create when becoming an unprivileged user

If you get an error similar to:  
```
fatal: [ponsfrilus]: FAILED! => {"msg": "Failed to set permissions on the temporary files Ansible needs to create when becoming an unprivileged user (rc: 1, err: chown: changing ownership of '/var/tmp/ansible-tmp-1586959025.216097-122038295697183/': Operation not permitted\nchown: changing ownership of '/var/tmp/ansible-tmp-1586959025.216097-122038295697183/AnsiballZ_stat.py': Operation not permitted\n}).

```
be sure that the `acl` package is installed on the host.

It's also can be workarounded with an `ansible.cfg` file in the project's root, with:  
```
[defaults]
allow_world_readable_tmpfiles=true
```
